1. How does the remote client determine when a command's output is fully received from the server, and what techniques can be used to handle partial reads or ensure complete message transmission?

The remote client determines that a command's output is fully received from the server when it encounters the EOF character (RDSH_EOF_CHAR). To handle partial reads, a single receive might return only one part of the output. Multiple receive calls might be needed to complete message transmission.

2. This week's lecture on TCP explains that it is a reliable stream protocol rather than a message-oriented one. Since TCP does not preserve message boundaries, how should a networked shell protocol define and detect the beginning and end of a command sent over a TCP connection? What challenges arise if this is not handled correctly?

A networked shell protocol should define and detect the beginning and end of a command sent over a TCP connection is to do a delimiter-based framing, length-prefixed mesages, or fixed-format headers. Challenges that can arrise is message fragmentation due to messages might arrive in multiple TCP segments, requiring reassembly. Another issue is partial read, where the recv() call might return fewer bytes than requested, or command interpretation errors where the shell might exectue partial commands or combine multiple commands incorrectly. 

3. Describe the general differences between stateful and stateless protocols.

Stateful protocols maintain information from past interactions and the server remembers client context and previous requests. Whereas stateless protocols treat each request as independent and self-contained and no session infomation is retained between requests.

4. Our lecture this week stated that UDP is "unreliable". If that is the case, why would we ever use it?

Why we would use UDP even if it's "unreliable" is due to its lack of overhead and connectionless nature makes it more efficient for high-bandwidth applications, such as video streaming, live broadcasts, and voice over IP. UDP is also better for stateless applications due to its simple request-response patterns where occasional loss is acceptable, UDP would reduce connection management overhead. 

5. What interface/abstraction is provided by the operating system to enable applications to use network communications?

The operating system provides sockets as the interface and abstraction for network communications as sockets serve as endpoints for sending and receiving data across a network, creating standardized API that applications can use regardless of the underlying network hardware or protocols.
